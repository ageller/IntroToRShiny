# Introduction To R Shiny

Shiny lets you build interactive dashboards and websites with R without knowing HTML, CSS, or Javascript.  Create tools for yourself, or share your data, analysis, and visualizations with the world through simple apps and interfaces.  This workshop covers the core components and syntax needed to build a Shiny application, and it provides a foundation for you to explore more advanced topics with Shiny's documentation on your own.  This workshop assumes familiarity with R at least at the level of the R Fundamentals Bootcamp.

In order to run the examples, you will need to install the following libraries in your R environment:
```
shiny
ggplot2
plotly
```

A live version of the final Shiny app is available [shinyapps.io here](https://ageller.shinyapps.io/introtorshiny/).

The presentation is also available on [Google Slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a-0efv2yNVp_NYNCrAZhBEFpfmKAvpTi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100526071325620132362&rtpof=true&sd=true).
