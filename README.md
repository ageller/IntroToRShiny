# Introduction To R Shiny

Shiny lets you build interactive dashboards and websites with R without knowing HTML, CSS, or Javascript.  Create tools for yourself, or share your data, analysis, and visualizations with the world through simple apps and interfaces.  This workshop covers the core components and syntax needed to build a Shiny application, and it provides a foundation for you to explore more advanced topics with Shiny's documentation on your own.  This workshop assumes familiarity with R at least at the level of the R Fundamentals Bootcamp.
