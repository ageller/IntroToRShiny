The notebooks in this directory are identical; one for Jupyter and one for R Markdown.  I converted the Jupyter notebook to R Markdown using the following command in R:
```
rmarkdown::convert_ipynb('test.ipynb')
```

(Please note that the Plotly figure will only be interactive in the Jupyter notebook.)

A working version of this notebook is available [on Google Colab here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FIFGOQ7Fe4TYhFXZPawWD5-4mTdwdyH7/view?usp=sharing).
